Ch2: Meaningful Names

- Distinguish names in such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer. If names must be different, then they should also mean something different.
- Noise words are another meaningless distinction. Product, ProductInfo and ProductData.
- Use Pronounceable Names. Not `genymdhms` (generation date, year, month, day, hour, minute, and second), but generationTimestamp.
- Use Searchable Names.
- Use Intention-Revealing Names and Avoid Disinformation.
- Unfortunately, smart people sometimes like to show off their smarts by demonstrating their mental juggling abilities.
- Clarity is king. Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.
- Say what you mean. Mean what you say.
- A consistent lexicon is a great boon to the programmers who must use your code.
- You will probably end up surprising someone when you rename, just like you might with any other code improvement. Donâ€™t let it stop you in your tracks.
