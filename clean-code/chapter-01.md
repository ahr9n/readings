Ch1: Clean Code

- “It was the bad code that brought the company down.”
- LeBlanc’s law: Later equals never.
- Over the span of a year or two, teams that were moving very fast at the beginning of a project can find themselves moving at a snail’s pace. Because of the bad code.
- Spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it’s a matter of professional survival. I can tell on that :3
- So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.
- They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; that’s their job. It’s your job to defend the code with equal passion.
- Programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen through a series of transformations till it is an elegantly coded sys.
- Each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.
- Code, without tests, is not clean. No matter how elegant it is, no matter how readable and accessible.
- Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.

Interesting point:
- When hand-washing was first recommended to physicians by Ignaz Semmelweis in 1847, it was rejected on the basis that doctors were too busy and wouldn’t have time to wash their hands between patient visits.
