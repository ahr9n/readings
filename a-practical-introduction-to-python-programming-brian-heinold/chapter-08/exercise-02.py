# 2. Write a program that allows the user to enter five numbers (read as strings). Create a string
# that consists of the userâ€™s numbers separated by plus signs. For instance, if the user enters 2,
# 5, 11, 33, and 55, then the string should be '2+5+11+33+55'.

print("+".join(list(input("Enter five separate numbers: ").split())))
