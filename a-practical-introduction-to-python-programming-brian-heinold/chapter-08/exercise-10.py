# 10. Write a censoring program. Allow the user to enter some text and your program should print
# out the text with all the curse words starred out. The number of stars should match the length
# of the curse word. For the purposes of this program, just use the “curse” words darn, dang,
# freakin, heck, and shoot. Sample output is below:
# Enter some text: Oh shoot, I thought I had the dang problem
# figured out. Darn it. Oh well, it was a heck of a freakin try.
# Oh *****, I thought I had the **** problem figured out.
# **** it. Oh well, it was a **** of a ****** try.

curse_words = ["darn", "dang", "freakin", "heck", "shoot"]
txt = input("Enter some text: ").split()

txt = [word if word not in curse_words else "*" * len(word) for word in txt]
print(" ".join(txt))
