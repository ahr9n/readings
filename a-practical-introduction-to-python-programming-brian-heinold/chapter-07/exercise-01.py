# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a list of integers. Do the following:
# (a) Print the total number of items in the list.
# (b) Print the last item in the list.
# (c) Print the list in reverse order.
# (d) Print Yes if the list contains a 5 and No otherwise.
# (e) Print the number of fives in the list.
# (f) Remove the first and last items from the list, sort the remaining items, and print the resut.
# (g) Print how many integers in the list are less than 5.


list_of_numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers: ")

list_of_numbers = list_of_numbers.split()
# explained in next chapter, but necessary to do it here
