# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a string. The program should create a new string
# called new_string from the userâ€™s string such that the second character is changed to an
# asterisk and three exclamation points are attached to the end of the string. Finally, print
# new_string. Typical output is shown below:
# Enter your string: Qbert
# Q*ert!!!

s = input("Enter your string: ")

new_string = s[0]
if len(s) > 1:
    new_string += "*"
    if len(s) >= 2:
        new_string += s[2 : len(s)]
new_string += "!!!"

print(new_string)
