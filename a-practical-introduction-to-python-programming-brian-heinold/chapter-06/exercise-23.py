# 23. A more general version of the above technique is the rail-fence cipher, where instead of break-
# ing things into evens and odds, they are broken up by threes, fours or something larger. For
# instance, in the case of threes, the string 'secret message' would be broken into three groups. The
# first group is sr sg, the characters at indices 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12. The second group is 'eemse', the
# characters at indices 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13. The last group is 'ctea', the characters at indices 2, 5, 8,
# and 11. The encrypted message is 'sr sgeemsectea'.

# (a) Write a program the asks the user for a string and uses the rail-fence cipher in the threes
# case to encrypt the string.
# (b) Write a decryption program for the threes case.
# (c) Write a program that asks the user for a string, and an integer determining whether to
# break things up by threes, fours, or whatever. Encrypt the string using the rail-fence
# cipher.
# (d) Write a decryption program for the general case.

for i in range(2, len(s), 3):
    three += s[i]

        three_idx += 1

            decrypted += list[j][list_idx[j]]

# too much unnecessary effort, if I want to do it manually, list is enough :)
