# 19. Write a program that draws “modular rectangles” like the ones below. The user specifies the
# width and height of the rectangle, and the entries start at 0 and increase typewriter fashion
# from left to right and top to bottom, but are all done mod 10. Below are examples of a 3×5
# rectangle and a 4×8.
# 0 1 2 3 4
# 5 6 7 8 9
# 0 1 2 3 4
# 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
# 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
# 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
# 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

width = eval(input("Enter the width: "))
height = eval(input("Enter the height: "))

now = 0
for i in range(height):
    for j in range(width):
        print(now, end=" ")
        now = (now + 1) % 10
    print("")  # new line
