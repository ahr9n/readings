# 14. This exercise is about the well-known Monty Hall problem. In the problem, you are a con-
# testant on a game show. The host, Monty Hall, shows you three doors. Behind one of those
# doors is a prize, and behind the other two doors are goats. You pick a door. Monty Hall, who
# knows behind which door the prize lies, then opens up one of the doors that doesnâ€™t contain
# the prize. There are now two doors left, and Monty gives you the opportunity to change your
# choice. Should you keep the same door, change doors, or does it not matter?
#
# (a) Write a program that simulates playing this game 10000 times and calculates what per-
# centage of the time you would win if you switch and what percentage of the time you
# would win by not switching.
# (b) Try the above but with four doors instead of three. There is still only one prize, and
# Monty still opens up one door and then gives you the opportunity to switch.
