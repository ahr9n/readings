# 11. Write a program that computes the factorial of a number. The factorial, n!, of a number n is the
# product of all the integers between 1 and n, including n. For instance, 5! = 1 路 2 路 3 路 4 路 5 = 120.
# [Hint: Try using a multiplicative equivalent of the summing technique.]

n = eval(input("Enter a number: "))

factorial = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial *= i

print("Factorial of", n, "is:", factorial)
