# 10. Write a multiplication game program for kids. The program should give the player ten ran-
# domly generated multiplication questions to do. After each, the program should tell them
# whether they got it right or wrong and what the correct answer is.

# Question 1: 3 x 4 = 12
# Right!
# Question 2: 8 x 6 = 44
# Wrong. The answer is 48.
# ...
# ...
# Question 10: 7 x 7 = 49
# Right.

from random import randint

for i in range(1, 11):
    a = randint(1, 100)  # for kids ;)
    b = randint(1, 100)
    print("Question ", i, ": ", a, " x ", b, " = ", sep="", end="")

    c = eval(input())
    if a * b == c:
        print("Right!")
    else:
        print("Wrong. The answer is", a * b)
